# Getting Started with My Coding Journey

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be documenting my adventures in learning to code and building cool stuff on the web.

## Why I Started Coding

I've always been fascinated by technology and how websites and applications work behind the scenes. The ability to create something from nothing, using just text in a file, seemed like a superpower I wanted to possess.

## What I'm Learning

Currently, I'm focusing on:

- HTML/CSS fundamentals
- JavaScript and its modern features
- Astro for building content-focused websites
- React for interactive components

## My Goals

With this blog, I plan to:

1. Track my progress as I learn new skills
2. Share challenges and solutions I discover
3. Build in public and get feedback
4. Connect with other learners and developers

Stay tuned for more posts about my coding journey, projects I'm working on, and things I find interesting in the tech world!
