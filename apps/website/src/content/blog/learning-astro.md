After researching various frameworks for building my personal blog, I settled on Astro. Here's why I think it's the perfect choice for content-focused websites.

## The "Islands" Architecture

```astro
---
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
---

<Image src="/images/astro-logo.png" alt="Astro Logo" />
```

One of Astro's key innovations is its islands architecture. This approach allows me to:

- Ship zero JavaScript by default for static content
- Add interactive components only where needed
- Mix and match UI frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte

This means my blog pages load incredibly fast while still allowing for rich interactivity when required.

## Content Collections

Astro's content collections feature provides a type-safe way to manage my blog posts. I can:

- Organize content with a defined schema
- Get automatic TypeScript types
- Query content with a simple API

This makes working with Markdown files a breeze compared to other systems I've tried.

## The Developer Experience

Beyond the technical benefits, Astro simply feels great to work with:

- Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) during development
- Intuitive file-based routing
- Great documentation and community support

I'm excited to continue building with Astro and exploring more of its capabilities as my blog grows!
